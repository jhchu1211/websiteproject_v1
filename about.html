                    My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I will be your instructor for the tutorial. I am currently the lead instructor and CTO at DevCamp. In addition to being the lead instructor for devCamp I've also been building web applications for over a decade for organizations such as Eventbrite and Quip.
                    
                    Throughout the video you'll learn skills such as:
                    - HTML5
                    - CSS3
                    - JavaScript
                    - Flexbox
                    - CSS Grid
                    - Animations
                    - Navigation
                    - Fonts
                    - Images
                    
                    I also demonstrate the process that I personally use when I build out my own websites. My goal for this video is not only to teach you how to follow along and build the website I show, but to teach you how to build any type of website that you want to create!
                    
                    There are no technical pre-requisites for going through this tutorial. The ideal student is an individual who wants to learn how to build and style websites, with a focus on real world development. After you have completed this tutorial, you will be able to build real world websites and learn the same concepts taught at the DevCamp code school. Additionally, because this is a project based course, after you've gone through the lessons you will have a full website portfolio that you can start adding your own websites to.
